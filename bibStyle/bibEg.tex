\section{Section}

We cite a paper~\cite{AuthorYear} in {\tt aBibFile.bib} using BibTeX style {\tt
vunsrt}. This style creates a clickable to the {\tt doi} when used along with
the hyperref package 

To compile this file one may need to run {\tt pdflatex} then {\tt biblatex} and
then {\tt pdflatex} two more times.
