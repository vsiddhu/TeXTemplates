Words again. We cite a paper~\cite{AuthorYear} in {\tt aBibFile.bib} using
BibTeX. To compile this file run {\tt pdflatex} then {\tt biblatex} and
then {\tt pdflatex} two more times.

\begin{equation}
    a = b + c
    \label{anEqn}
\end{equation}

Cite this equation later using~\eqref{anEqn}. This paper has Supporting
information~(SI) sections like~\ref{Supp} and that SI has~\ref{AppASub}
